    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
      box-sizing: border-box

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
      - <a>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
      The "fix" for the box model is to apply box-sizing: border-box; to the html. The box model
      is how manipulate HTML elements. It allows you to set padding (internal spacing, fromt the
      document content's edge to the edge of the padding size), set margin (the distance between 
      elements), as well as a variety of borders. Additionally, you can assigne properties like
      width and height to further control the appearance of HTML elements.
